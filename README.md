# MBA611-AdvancedDataAnalysis
A repository to document a journey of progression built upon a foundation of recurring struggle followed by resolution
This repository is the start of a mess that will hopefully turn into something more appetizing.
Based on a 5-year adventure that began with a man asking the most open, hard to answer question: what is big data?

This repository will be shared with academics and young scholars like me, but please note:
all of my work is my own, please ask me before borrowing anything I write :)
